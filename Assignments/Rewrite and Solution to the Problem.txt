Problem
Write a class definition of swimmingPool to be used in creating a 
swimming pool class. The class should require variables to store 
the length, width, and depth in feet. It also requires a variable 
to store the rate of gallons per minute of filling the pool, and 
also the rate of draining the pool as well. There also needs to be 
functions to tell the amount of water needed to fill a pool when itâ€™s 
empty or somewhat filled. The amount of time required to fill the pool 
or empty it.

Solution
I would start out by creating the class definition. I would determine 
the appropriate names of the variables and the functions. I will make 
it so the user will input the dimensions of the pool, for which will 
be stored in variables. I also need a way for the user to show if the 
pool already contains any water. I would create two functions that deal 
with the amount of time being used to fill the pool and emptying it, and 
determining the amount of water being used to fill and empty the pool. 
Depending on how I make the functions, I might need to make another function 
to bring the time and water usage together to determine the rate of filling 
the pool and emptying it. I will display the results of the amount of time it 
will take to empty the pool or fill it, but it will depend if the pool already 
has water in it.
